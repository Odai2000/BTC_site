          <h2>How it works?</h2>

          <p>
            Image compression is a fundamental technique in digital data
            processing, aimed at reducing the data size of images while
            maintaining their quality as much as possible. It plays a pivotal
            role in enhancing storage efficiency and minimizing bandwidth
            consumption when transmitting images over networks, enabling its
            application across diverse fieldsâ€”from mobile devices to large-scale
            databases.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project focuses on implementing grayscale image compression
            techniques using Block Truncation Coding (BTC), an effective and
            straightforward approach for balancing image quality and file size
            after compression. The project examines various BTC applications,
            including the standard BTC technique, as well as advanced methods
            like AM-BTC and MM-BTC. Each technique is analyzed and evaluated in
            terms of compression quality and speed.
          </p>

          <p>
            A new .btc file format has been developed as part of the project to
            store the binary representation of compressed images, significantly
            reducing file size. Additionally, a program was developed to
            decompress .btc files and reconstruct the original image with
            manageable data loss, achieving an optimal balance between quality
            retention and minimized storage requirements. This solution provides
            users with a practical and efficient way to store and manage images.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, the project includes a web-based system that allows users
            to access image compression and decompression services efficiently
            and conveniently. This study aims to provide a comprehensive
            overview of the effectiveness of BTC techniques for grayscale
            images, evaluating compression results based on technical metrics
            such as Compression Ratio (CR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM),
            and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). This insight enriches the
            understanding of BTC applications in digital image processing and
            brings image compression services directly to users through an
            accessible online platform.
